## Booking and Cancellation

1. How can I change my booking?
	* The ticket number must start with 724 (SWISS ticket no./plate).
	* The ticket was not paid for by barter or voucher (there are exceptions to voucher payments; if the ticket was paid for in full by voucher, then it may be possible to rebook online under certain circumstances. If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).
	* There must be an active flight booking for your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without the corresponding flight segments online at the moment.
	* It is currently only possible to rebook outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).
2. Which tickets/bookings cannot be rebooked online currently?
	* Bookings containing flight segments with other airlines
	* Bookings containing reservations, where a ticket has not yet been issued
	* Bookings with several valid tickets for the same person and route
	* Tickets with a status other than O (open) (A)
	* Bookings with segments with a status other than OK (e.g. containing flight segments with the status Waitlist) (HK|RR)
	* Tickets that do not display the tariff calculation (IT tickets)

Based on the company policy, if your ticket is eligible for rebooking, you may be able to change your flight to a later time on the same day. For Economy Flex and Business Flex fares, there's a special service that allows free rebooking to an earlier flight on the same day, but since you are looking to leave later, this specific service would not apply.

To check if your booking is eligible for a rebooking and to proceed with changing your flight, I will now transfer this request to our specialized assistant who can assist you further with the process.

Can a name be changed after a booking is made?\n\t* The correct name(s) of the customer travelling need to be entered in a booking. The first and last name of the passenger travelling needs to be entered exactly as in the travel documents. Entering a middle name is optional and can be added in the first name field. However, there is a character limitation for this field.\n\t* Your first and middle name is stored by the system spelled together without spaces.

What do I need to consider?\n\t* You can change your flight booking online, but your Travel Agency will not have access to your new electronic ticket.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Frequently asked questions: European fare concept\nCan a particular Economy fare be fully booked?\nNo. As long as there are still seats in Economy Class, all three Economy fares will always be available in every available booking class .\n\nCan the SWISS fares be booked on codeshare flights operated by other airlines? What happens when changing a flight from a SWISS-operated flight to a codeshare flight (e.g. Zurich-Lisbon with TAP Portugal)?\nThe fares Economy Classic, Economy Flex and Business can be booked on codeshare flights. Economy Light can only be booked on flights operated by SWISS (airline code LX). For technical reasons, seats cannot be reserved on codeshare flights for the time being.\n\nWhy doesn\'t SWISS offer an Economy Flex fare for groups?\nGroup bookings can be changed to any fare option free of charge until the time the ticket is issued provided that the same price is still available. The Economy Flex fare therefore does not provide an additional benefit for groups, and so we do not offer it.\n\nCan the additional options (advance seat reservation, additional baggage etc.) always be changed?\nThe additional options cannot be rebooked with Economy Light because the fare itself cannot be changed. With the Economy Classic fare, the additional options can only be booked on the same reservation.\n\nIs it possible to pay for an upgrade to Business Class with the Economy Light, Economy Classic and Economy Flex fares?\nWenn Sie einen Tarif Economy Light, Economy Classic oder Economy Flex gebucht haben, können Sie ein Upgrade in die Business Class buchen, das viele Leistungen der Business Class enthält. Es ist via swiss.com oder dem SWISS Service Center buchbar.\n\nWhat do status customers (HON Circle Member, Senator, Frequent Traveller) need to consider when choosing a fare?\nTarif Economy Light does not include free advanced seat reservation or any additional baggage (e.g. golf equipment). All other status benefits, such as free lounge access, remain unchanged with this fare.\n\nWhat do SWISS Golf Traveller Club members need to consider when choosing a fare?\nIm Tarif Economy Light ist keine kostenlose Mitnahme von Golfgepäck möglich.\n\nWhat are the differences in the miles credits with the various fares?\nThe number of miles credited is still determined by the booking class.\n\nIf I have booked a Light fare and paid for an additional item of baggage and then cancel my flight, do I lose everything?\nLike the Ecnomy Light fare, the charge for the first item of paid baggage will not be reimbursed, nor can it be used for a different flight.\n\nIf I book an Economy Classic fare and travel without checked baggage, will I be reimbursed for the baggage not taken?\nNo; no refunds are given for any services included in a fare that are not used.\n\nWhat is the difference between the 1 st bag and the additional bag?\nThe 1 st bag can only be purchased with the Economy Light fare. It costs less than the additional item of baggage.\n\nWith the Economy Light fare, how can I purchase a 1 st bag (max. 23 kg) in addition?\nThe first 1 st bag in the Economy Light fare can be purchased through your travel agent, through swiss.com (up to 6 hours before departure), the SWISS Service Center (up to 24 hours before departure) or at the airport. The price at the airport will be higher than for purchasing in advance. The charge is due for each flight route.\n\nIf I am asked at the gate to check in my baggage, can I quickly purchase it online in order to benefit from the lower price?\nNo; you can only purchase it via swiss.com up to1 hour before departure. Different prices apply at the airport.\n\nHow many additional items of baggage can I purchase?\nYou can purchase a maximum of two additional items of baggage via swiss.com. If you are going through a travel agent, you can purchase a maximum of one 1 st bag plus one additional bag.if you go through the SWISS Service Center, there is no limit to the number of additional items of baggage you may purchase.\n\nSWISS Economy Flex: what does the “Change to earlier flight on the same day” service offer?\nApplies to "Economy Flex" and "Business Flex" fares. Rebooking free of charge is possible only on the day of departure during online check-in via lufthansa.com or the Lufthansa app, or at a check-in machine or check-in counter at the airport. Applies to direct flights only. A change of route or airline is not possible.\n\n\n' name='lookup_policy' id='3dd9f3d9-4f64-4cd1-8269-b46bf9c77e4e' tool_call_id='call_76225f10b3c84043832ccc'
